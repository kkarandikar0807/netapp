# Angular Dev Test

In this round of the interview process you will be asked to interpret product requirements and build simple features. You will use this project repo for your development and be asked to discuss your work when finished. Requirements will be sent on the day of your scheduled test.

## Before your scheduled test:

* Clone this repository and familiarize yourself with the project structure, itâ€™s dependencies and existing code.
* Install the dependencies and ensure you can serve the application locally and run the tests.
* Send any questions to the recruiter via email.

## During your scheduled test:

* Feature requirements will be sent at the beginning of the scheduled test.
* A WebEx with our engineers will be setup for you to ask any questions.
* You will have 1 hour to complete as many of the features with quality.
* At the end of the 1 hour session you will have 30 minutes to discuss your work with the engineers.

## Setup

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.4.

In order to develop against this project, you will need Node.JS 8.x, and `npm` at least at version 5.0. To set up the project, open a terminal, navigate to the directory of the project, and run `npm install`. Once you have installed the dependencies, you can begin running the command below.

You may also be required to install the Angular CLI. If any of the commands below don't work, and the error references the `ng` command or the Angular CLI being missing, run `npm install -g @angular/cli`.

Since all of the build process run from a terminal, there is no restriction to what IDE or editor you can use. Feel free to use whatever editor you are most comfortable with, but make sure to add any IDE specific configuration files to the project `.gitignore` file.

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. It will also start a mock API server on `http://localhost:4000` and proxy calls to that server through port 4200.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `npm run e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/). **You must have the Chrome browser installed to run the e2e tests.**

The e2e directory has the skeleton for a page object and an e2e test spec.
Jasmine matchers are used for the examples: https://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction.html
